Find what you're looking for even faster, and let Keep do the remembering for you.A wolf howling at the full moon is a well-known sight in popular media, but wolves don’t actually do that. They do howl for other reasons, though. Each wolf has his own distinct howl, and wolves use their howls to communicate with members of their packs or to scare other wolves away from their territory. And a wolf’s howl can be heard up to 10 miles away!
Wolves are pretty similar to dogs in the ways they communicate. Along with howling, they use other sounds to talk to each other, like whining, growling, snarling, yelping and barking. And also like dogs, they use scent and body language to communicate.
